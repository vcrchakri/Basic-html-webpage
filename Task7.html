    <h3>
        Machine Learning (ML)
     </h3>
        <dl>
            Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on building
             systems that learn from and make decisions based on data. This course typically covers 
             supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and neural networks. 
             Key topics include regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning. 
             Students also explore popular ML libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn.

    <h3>
        Computer Science (CS)
    </h3>
        <dl>
            Computer Science is a broad and foundational course that encompasses the study of algorithms,
             data structures, software design, and the theoretical underpinnings of computing.
             It provides students with essential programming skills and a deep understanding of how computers 
             solve problems.Key languages and paradigms such as Python, Java, and C++ are often covered.
        </dl>
    <h3>
        Data Science
    </h3>
        <dl>
       
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistical analysis, data visualization, and 
programming to extractinsights from data.This course teaches students how to handle large datasets,
 perform data cleaning, and use statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to analyze data.
  Tools like R, Python, and SQL are commonly used.
    </dl>
    <h3>
        Artificial Intelligence(AI)
    </h3>
    <dl>
       
Artificial Intelligence is a course that delves into the creation of intelligent agents and systems capable
 of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. It covers a range of topics from basic
  AI principles to advanced techniques in natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
